            <p class="lead">I am a university student who was born in San Antonio Texas. I have a dual citizenship of both Mexico and the United States, and I often go to Mexico. I spend almost all my life in San Antonio as I did live in Mexico for a bit and I lived in Corpus Christi for 2 years but all of my schooling before university was in San Antonio.</p>
