            <p class="lead">My favorite movie is probably <i>8 Mile</i> as my favoirte arist Eminem is in it and is a movie that contains autobiographical elements from his like which as a major fan I for one love seeing that glimps into his life and giving the viewer an idea of how he got inspired to write all of his songs and his drive to do so. I also like <i>The Dark Night, Snowpiercer, Spiderman 3, Demon Slayer Mugen Train, PELE, and The Wolf of Wall Street</i></p>
